Farmagatchi is our web application that creates a virtual character for you to play with, take care of, and level up in order to progress throughout the game. Users will create an account that is exclusive to themselves, and have their game progress saved in order to come back to where their farmagatchi previously left off! 

The primary aspect of the game is to manage your farm, which includes taking care of your farmagatchi as well as your crops. If taken care of regularly, your farmagatchi may turn into a fully grown farmagatchi. 

Features of this game include, but are not limited to logging into your character and giving it nourishment (such as food and water). Steps taken in the day will be tracked via your device and the amount of steps taken will be used as currency and a fitness score for your farmagatchi. Weather APIâ€™s will be used to determine based on the weather what actions are necessary to perform in the day (Eg. if it is a sunny day, you need to water your farmagatchi). A chat room will also be included to communicate with other users. There will also be a quiz-like educational game where the user has to learn and answer questions 

The problem at hand that is being tackled is that many people and children are all drawn to their phones and do not have motivation to get up, be active, and/or learn. Currently this problem has not been addressed deeply and there are not many people trying to fix this issue as it is a challenge to get people to want such an application. This project is intended to get people moving, learn, and also have fun! A balance of all three is key to a good application. 

The target audience for our game is for children and adults 4 and up, but the primary audience that will use the game will be mainly older adolescents and young adults. 

Yes, the current amount of work seems to be enough for a group of five people, however if at any point the work seems to be far too little, more sub-programs or functionalities can be added to the game in order to make the work-load sufficient/reasonable. Conversely, if the work is too much, we can decide to drop some unneeded features from the project to reduce the workload.
